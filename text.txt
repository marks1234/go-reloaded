I was so (butt, 03) tired ,but I had to keep going . There it was. A enormous opportunity ahead of me. I had 1A (hex) chances to make it work. 
What were the odds? They were 1010 (bin) to 1!
My friends were like ' you got this ' and ' just keep pushing (up) (low) '.But deep inside, I was a emotional wreck (cap).
"My first step is A experiment," I thought. I started working and  after 10 (bin) 1010 (bin) days, I had a Breakthrough (cap). 
This is a exciting (up) moment in my life and I feel fantastic (up, 2) ! As Steve Jobs once said, ' stay hungry, stay foolish '.
I had achieved it. The quest for a simple life was over. I am ' truly grateful (cap, 2) ' for what I have become.
And then, BAMM !! I woke up from my dream ... Was it all just a illusion (cap) ?

If I make you BREAKFAST IN BED (low, 3) just say thank you instead of: how (cap) did you get in my house (up, 2) ?

I have to pack 101 (bin) outfits. Packed 1a (hex) just to be sure

Don not be sad ,because sad backwards is das . And das not good
