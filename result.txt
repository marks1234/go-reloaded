I was so (butt, 03) tired, but I had to keep going. There it was. An enormous opportunity ahead of me. I had 26 chances to make it work. What were the odds? They were 10 to 1!
My friends were like 'you got this' and 'just keep Pushing'. But deep inside, I was an emotional Wreck. "My first step is An experiment," I thought. I started working and after 2 10 days, I had a Breakthrough. This is an EXCITING moment in my life and I FEEL FANTASTIC! As Steve Jobs once said, 'stay hungry, stay foolish'.
I had achieved it. The quest for a simple life was over. I am 'Truly Grateful' for what I have become.
And then, BAMM!! I woke up from my dream... Was it all just an Illusion?

If I make you breakfast in bed just say thank you instead of: How did you get in MY HOUSE?

I have to pack 5 outfits. Packed 26 just to be sure

Don not be sad, because sad backwards is das. And das not Good
