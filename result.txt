I was so tired, but I had to keep going. There it was. A enormous opportunity ahead of me. I had 26 chances to make it work. What were the odds? They were 10 to 1!
My friends were like 'you got this' and 'just keep pushing'. But deep inside, I was a emotional wreck.
"My first step is A experiment," I thought. I started working and after 2 10 days, I had a Breakthrough. This is a EXCITING moment in my life and I FEEL FANTASTIC! As Steve Jobs once said, 'stay hungry, stay foolish'.
I had achieved it. The quest for a simple life was over. I am 'Truly Grateful' for what I have become.
And then, BAMM!! I WOKE up from my dream... Was it all just a Illusion?
